# Cubic Zirconia Î”

The result of an inside joke; a Discord bot which drops randomized product links between a specified interval with the power of *Scrapy* and *Discord.py*.  Also an amalgamation of terribly executed ideas such as a global stock market simulator.

## Installation

### Setting Up The Entire Bot

First, clone the repository in your desired directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/JetstreamAQ/Cubic-Zirconia.git
```

In order for the bot to run and function as intented, you need to install the required packages -- this can be done as follows:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not want to install these packages globally, then it is recommended to create and run the bot under a virtual environment.  This can easily be done with the following commands:

```
pip install virtualenv
python venv [ENVIRONMENT NAME]
source [ENVIRONMENT NAME]/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you will need to create a `.env` file in the bot's root directory.  In it, place the following lines and fill in the variables with the necessary information

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=[...]
MASTER_SERVER_ID=[...]
OWNER_ID=[...]
```

Once that is done, you will need to setup a Discord bot application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) if you have not done so already.

Next, ensure that the bot has the following permissions and scopes:

> Permissions
> 	- Send Messages
>	- Use Slash Commands
> Scopes
>	- bot
>	- applications.commands

Finally, invite the bot into your server and run it with `python3 main.py`.

Alternatively, you can utilize the provided `run.sh` script.  However, if you have not setup a virtual environment for the bot then you can comment out the second last line: `. bot-env/bin/activate`.  Moreover, if your virtual environment is named something other than `bot-env` then modify the command to match the name of your environment.

### Installing Only The Needed Cogs

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JetstreamAQ/Cubic-Zirconia.git
```

For reference, the following cogs refer to these bot functions:

> `rec.py` -> The scraping & recommendation system

> `stocks.py` -> the scuffed stock market simulator game

Take the relevant files and place them in them where you normally put your bot's cogs.

If you are making use of `rec.py`, then take the entire `scraper` directory and place it in your bot's root directory.  Afterwards, you will need to initalize a `.env` file if you have not done so yet.  In it place `HOME_SERVER_ID` and `OWNER_ID` variables with their respective values.

Finally, you can either reload your bot's cogs or simply reboot your entire bot -- whichever way you have setup or prefer.  Afterwards, you should now be able to use the relevant functionalities of this bot within your own.

Please ensure that the following dependencies are installed for the given cogs.
> **rec.py**
> 	- discord-py-slash-command
>	- scrapy
>	- scrapy-user-agents

> **stocks.py**
>	- You don't need anything extra.

> **audio.py**
>	- yt-dlp
>	- PyNaCl

## Usage
You can view all available commands with `+help`

### rec.py
Once the bot is running, you will need to initiate a crawl.  This is done with the following command:

> +initiateCrawl [OR] +ic

The bot will go down for a bit as it grabs the links.

Once the bot has finished, it will drop a random link the the channel which recieved the latest message (that it has read permissions for) every 10 messages by default.  The interval can be changed with the following command:

> +messageGap (num)
> +mg (num)

If you want a random product link right now, then just run the following command:

> +recommend [OR] +rec [OR] +r [OR] /recommend

### stocks.py
Everything should be good to go once the bot is running.  You can play around with the following commands

> +invest [name (in quotes if there are spaces in it)] [num]

Invest `num` stocks of `name`

> +portfolio

Request your own investment portfolio for the current server

> +sell [name (in quotes if there are spaces in it)] [num]

Sell `num` stocks of `name`

> +stockPrice

Get the prices of currently available listings

### audio.py
Once the cog is loaded, everything should work given the correct dependencies are also installed.

> +play [Search terms OR URL]

Plays the searched/specified video if there is not one playing.  The command can be run without parameters to play the first video in the queue.

> +queue [Search terms OR URL]

Queues the searched/specified video.

> +viewQueue

View the video queue.  Takes a while since the bot retrieves the video titles from their respective URLs instead of storing them.

> +remove [index]

Remove a video from the queue by specifying the relevant index.  Video indexes can be found from using `+viewQueue`

> +next

Skip to the next video in the queue if there is anything.  Doesn't do anything if the bot is currently not playing anything.

> +stop

Stops playing the current video.

> +pause

Pauses the current video, allowing it to be resumed.

> +resume

Resumes the paused video.
